Bharath received a BA and BS from UC Berkeley in EECS and Mathematics and was valedictorian of his graduating class in mathematics. He did his PhD in computer science at Stanford University where he studied the application of deep-learning to problems in drug-discovery. At Stanford, Bharath created the [deepchem.io](https://deepchem.io) open-source project to grow the deep drug discovery open source community, co-created the [moleculenet.ai](https://moleculenet.ai) benchmark suite to facilitate development of molecular algorithms, and [more](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LOdVDNYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Bharath's graduate education was supported by a [Hertz Fellowship](http://hertzfoundation.org/default.aspx), the most selective graduate fellowship in the sciences. After his PhD, Bharath co-founded [Computable](https://computable.io/) a startup that built better tools for collaborative dataset management. Bharath is currently working actively on growing the DeepChem community and on exploring a few early projects still in stealth.

Bharath is the lead author of ["TensorFlow for Deep Learning: From Linear Regression to Reinforcement Learning"](https://www.amazon.com/TensorFlow-Deep-Learning-Regression-Reinforcement/dp/1491980451), a developer's introduction to modern machine learning, with [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/), and the lead author of ["Deep Learning for the Life Sciences"](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Life-Sciences-Microscopy/dp/1492039837)
